			<ul>
				<li>
					Retinoblastoma is a rare but critical form of cancer that affects the eyes of 8,000 children around the world each year.
				</li>
				<li>
					Unfortunately, because early detection is often unavailable, 5,600 (70%) of these children die, particularly those living in developing countries where access to specialized care is limited.
				</li>
				<li>
					Expert care for retinoblastoma is only available in a limited number of centres around the world. Even within developed countries, only 640 (8%) of affected children have access to effective care.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				That is why we launched a global research initiative called One Retinoblastoma World, which envisions a clear path to optimized care for children worldwide.

			<h2>Telemedicine and ROP</h2>
			<p>
				Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a disorder that primarily affects premature babies. The smaller a child is, the more likely they are to develop ROP, typically in both eyes. ROP is one of the most common causes of loss of vision for children, and can lead to lifelong impairment or blindness.<br><br>
				SickKids has driven the alternative use of a specialized camera to capture photographs of the interior surface of the eye, which can then be sent to expert ophthalmologists for diagnosis. While ophthalmic imaging is a skill that requires specialized training, SickKids has been successful in using live, two-way audio-video connections to train nurses to capture these images, even if they have no experience in ophthalmology or ophthalmic photography. This research has been a corner stone for the development of the Ontario ROP Telemedicine Program, which helps train neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) nurses already working in remote hospitals to learn this new skill.<br><br>
				These research-based programs have not only created significant reductions in health-care costs, they have also eliminated the potential for death that occurs when premature infants need to be transferred between treatment centres.

				Child eye care advocacy
			</h2>
			<p>
				Children are not small adults — their eyes are different and require proper development to be healthy. Our Child Eye Care Advocacy research program develops unique and effective eye care strategies that are critical for promoting excellent vision.<br><br>
				Research on strategies that improve overall health is of growing interest for decision makers when allocating resources. Our long-term goal is to devise the best and most cost-effective eye care strategies for children of all ages in Ontario.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Ocular Genetics
			</h2>
			<p>
				The field of Ocular Genetics has grown significantly in the last decade, with over 300 genes now associated with diseases of the eye. We are one of the largest users of genetic testing in Canada. This has allowed us to decipher the basis of several eye disorders through our research. <br><br>
				Dr. Héon leads numerous genetic studies of eye disorders that are present at birth and deteriorate over time, known as retinal dystrophies. Our patients have benefitted from access to the earliest clinical trials of new therapeutic interventions, such as gene replacement therapy. The application of innovative therapies to treat inherited forms of blindness is rapidly evolving, and we are prepared to be active players in this exciting new era.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Surgical innovation
			</h2>
			<p>
				Surgical Innovation is a research program that focuses on techniques to improve the management of various kinds of vision loss, including trauma, severe retinal damage, and deformities of the eye existing at birth. <br><br>
				This means introducing new techniques and instrumentation, improving ways of planning surgery using imaging, and reviews of surgical outcomes. The goal of the program is to improve care for these patients, many of whom have very complex problems that demand unconventional solutions. Innovative techniques developed and studied in our department include conventional and selective corneal transplantation, ocular surface reconstruction and glaucoma surgery.
