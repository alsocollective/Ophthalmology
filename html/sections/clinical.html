			Retinoblastoma is a form of cancer that rapidly develops from a child’s retina cells, and is the most common form of malignant tumor found in children’s eyes. Unfortunately, 70% of cases worldwide lead to death, with a disproportionate number of deaths occurring in developing countries where access to early detection is unavailable. Our Retinoblastoma Service manages the care of 80% the newly diagnosed Canadian children each year, with 22 new cases predicted annually. Led by Dr. Gallie, our team works in collaboration with referring doctors, so that afflicted children can travel to SickKids to receive active care. This unit is made up of a wide range of health-care professionals, including ophthalmologists, oncologists, social workers, nurses, imaging specialists and genetic counselors. Treatment often involves use of highly specialized equipment and innovative therapies.

	<h2>Case Study: Innovative Treatment <br>restores eye sensation</h2>

				Abby Messner lost feeling in her left eye after a non-malignant tumour in her brain was removed at age 11. As a result of this condition – called corneal anaesthesia – her eye would not blink to protect against dust and debris. Despite her best efforts to care for her eye, this led to a scar forming on her cornea that doctors worried would lead to permanent vision loss.
			</p>
			<p class="colapsible hidden">
				Her condition also prevented her from enjoying her favourite activities, such as playing competitive sports like hockey and swimming, or just entering the dry air of a mall. Even a windy day posed a danger to Abby’s eye.
				<br>
				This led SickKids’ Dr. Ali to propose an innovative new surgery for Abby – a nerve graft that would restore feeling to her left eye. 
				<br>
				Working with plastic and reconstructive surgeons at the hospital, Dr. Ali developed a treatment that took a nerve from Abby’s calf, transplanted it into her functioning right eye, and connected it to her left eye.
				<br>
				Within three months, sensation was restored. This new treatment addressed the root problem of the condition rather than its complications, in a less invasive fashion than other surgeries used to treat corneal anaesthesia.
				<br>
				SickKids has since used this surgery in seven other cases and continues to study the effects of the treatment.
