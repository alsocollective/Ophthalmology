	<blockquote class="white">Abby Messner lost feeling in her left eye after a non-malignant tumour in her brain was removed at age 11. As a result of this condition—called corneal anaesthesia—her eye would not blink to protect against dust and debris. Despite her best efforts to care for her eye, this led to a scar forming on her cornea that doctors worried would lead to permanent vision loss.</blockquote>

	<p class="tightmid">Her condition also prevented her from enjoying her favourite activities, such as playing competitive sports like hockey and swimming, or just entering the dry air of a mall. Even a windy day posed a danger to Abby’s eye.

	This led SickKids’ Dr. Ali to propose an innovative new surgery for Abby—a nerve graft that would restore feeling to her left eye.

	Working with plastic and reconstructive surgeons at the hospital, Dr. Ali developed a treatment that took a nerve from Abby’s calf, transplanted it into her functioning right eye, and connected it to her left eye. 

	Within three months, sensation was restored. This new treatment addressed the root problem of the condition rather than its complications, in a less invasive fashion than other surgeries used to treat corneal anaesthesia. 

	SickKids has since used this surgery in seven other cases and continues to study the effects of the treatment.</p>
