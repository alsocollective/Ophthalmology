	<h2>Our Fellowships</h2>
	<blockquote class="nodashafter">Our program in Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus has trained well over 100 fellows since its inception more than 40 years ago, and is accredited by the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology. We train four fellows every year, making it one of the world’s largest fellowship programs focused on vision sciences.</blockquote>

					<p>The Retinoblastoma Clinical Fellowship is a one-year program that recruits fully trained ophthalmologists who will focus their life’s work on retinoblastoma—a form of eye cancer.</p>
					<a href="#readmore">read more</a>
					<span class="block">
						<p>Fellows may enter the program based on funding they have received, or the department will seek out funding for them on a case-bycase basis when we determine that the training will play a key role in equipping the fellow to enhance global retinoblastoma care. We also welcome ophthalmologists, who are already leaders in retinoblastoma in their country, to join us for three-to-six month observerships.</p><p>Past fellows continue to consult with us on difficult cases, using innovative digital tools for sharing care decisions, and actively participate in One Retinoblastoma World initiatives.</p>

				<td colspan="1">
					<p>The Neuro-Ophthalmology Fellowship program is one of a few in the world that offers training dedicated exclusively to children.<a href="#readmore">Read More</a><span> We provide extensive exposure to the complete spectrum of paediatric neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. Organized around the principle of graduated responsibility, fellows develop knowledge, competence, and confidence in diagnosis, as well as skills for medical and surgical management of common and rare neuro-ophthlamologic conditions under the close supervision of staff physicians. Through multidisciplinary consultations and co-management of patients, we offer numerous opportunities for educational interactions with related specialties, including neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-oncology, neruoradiology, neuropathology and craniofacial anomalies.</span></p>
					
					<span class="block">
						<p>Another unique feature of the fellowship is a strong component of research training, with ample protected time for fellows to complete rigorous research under the guidance of experienced clinician-scientists and clinicians. Upon completion of their training, fellows are expected to become a leader in this field.</p>

				<td colspan="1">
					<p>We are the only department in the world to have two staff physicians specially trained in both paediatric ophthalmology, as well as in cornea and external diseases, which includes developmental, infective and inflammatory diseases that lead to scarring and need for corneal transplantation.</p>
					<a href="#readmore">Read More</a>
					<span class="block">
						<p>Our unique expertise and the wide variety of cases allow us to offer the world’s only dedicated training fellowship in paediatric cornea and external diseases. The aim of the fellowship is to train ophthalmologists who will become national leaders for children’s corneal disease in their home country. Our first fellow, Dr. Uri Elbaz, came from Israel in 2012 and is expected to become a national expert in this field upon his return.</p>

					<span class="block">
						<p>Through the program, we help trainees acquire the knowledge and skills needed to diagnose a wide range of genetically determined eye disorders. These include inherited retinal dystrophies, genetically determined complex syndromes with ocular manifestations, and metabolic disorders. Knowledge underlying genetics of anterior segment disorders and cancer is also gained. Our fellows gain a deep understanding of the mechanism underlying the diseases, and learn about evolving treatment approaches in the field including gene therapy. The trainee gains good exposure to interpretation of visual electrophysiology and genetic results. They learn to analyze exome/genome data and to provide ethical genetic counseling.</p>
