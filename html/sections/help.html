	<blockquote>The wide range of diseases and disorders that can impact a child’s vision pose considerable challenges to healthcare providers, but even bigger challenges to the child and their family. We are still working to understand the full scope of the visual system and the ailments that affect it. <br/>

	When you support SickKids Ophthalmology, you are helping change lives. 
	We work to provide the most comprehensive clinical care to our patients here in Toronto, while developing innovative new treatments that save eyes and lives around the world. In this section you will learn about the challenges we still face and how your support can help us in our mission.</blockquote>

	<h2 class="tightmid">Equipment Needs</h2>
	<p class="tightmid">The speed of innovation in ophthalmology is tremendous. New technologies constantly emerge to improve the diagnosis and management of eye diseases. We strive to constantly improve the instruments and diagnostic equipment we use for the care of our patients. The total cost for all of this equipment would be more than $1,000,000. Every dollar you contribute to SickKids Ophthalmology helps.</p>

	<h2 class="tightmid">RECRUITING CLINICIAN-SCIENTISTS</h2>
	<p class="tightmid">Clinician-scientists function as bridges between the medical and the scientific worlds by interacting with patients, observing the clinical features of their diseases, and then developing basic science experiments to test new ideas that stem from their observations. As clinical and scientific knowledge continues to increase exponentially, recruitment of the best and brightest clinician-scientists is critical to our long-term success. However, clinician-scientists require extensive training, infrastructural support, and “protected time” for them to perform research. Funding to support their salary and research—in the form of an endowed Chair or Professorship—is crucial for us to train, recruit and retain talented clinician-scientists who recognize the relevance of scientific discovery and how it changes patients’ lives. Your contribution can help us create this important endowment.</p>

	<h2 id="whatcomesnext">What Comes Next</h2>
	<blockquote>In the next five years, SickKids Ophthalmology will continue to build on 
	our existing strengths to achieve a new level of excellence, by developing themes that unify our clinical, research, and educational activities.

	This will include use of an evidence-based approach to evaluate and determine the services that we provide, making a real impact on national and global health, and enhancing knowledge translation from research into practical application. 

	The support of philanthropic leaders like you is more important than ever, so that we can continue to set our sights high and keep working to advance children’s eye health in profound new ways.</blockquote>
